DEPRECATED
==========

Please take a look at **[Doca](https://github.com/cloudflare/doca)**, our new,
improved, and actively supported JSON Schema documentation system.

The last known good release of this project is tagged as
[v2.1.2](https://github.com/cloudflare/json-schema-docs-generator/tree/v2.1.2)

A few additional pull requests have been merged on master to wrap things
up here, but the current state of master has not been broadly tested.

For more information on how this project worked, see the
[old README](https://github.com/cloudflare/json-schema-docs-generator/blob/master/OLD_README.md).
